#Hook Testing!

This is an app for testing some hooks.  There are many types of hooks.  I will now list all types of hooks known to exist.

1. Captain
2. Web
3. Fishing
4. s
5. And more!

I will now test each type of hook.

1. The Captain says please bring me my wine.  And fails.
2. The Web entangles you in it's grasp.  And wins.
3. The fishing returns several fish.  And wins.
4. s is just a letter.  
5. There are no more.
